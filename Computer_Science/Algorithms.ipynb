B-trees are similar to red-black trees but they are better at minimizing disk I/O operations. Many database systems use B-trees, or variants of B-trees, to store information. B-trees differ from red-black trees in that B-tree nodes may have many children, from a few to thousands. That is, the “branching factor” of a B-tree can be quite large, although it usually depends on characteristics of the disk unit used. B-trees are similar to red-black trees in that every n-node B-tree has height $O(\\log n)$. The exact height of a B-tree can be considerably less than that of a red-black tree,however, because its branching factor, and hence the base of the logarithm that expresses its height, can be much larger. Therefore, we can also use B-trees to implement many dynamic-set operations in time $O(\\log n)$.\n",
